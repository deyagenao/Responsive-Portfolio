            <p>Welcome to my portfolio page! After serving as an educator in the Bronx, New York for the past 5 years, I have chosen to pursue a career change in full stack web development. Currently, I am enrolled in Columbia's Coding Bootcamp to develop the skills that are most in demand in this field.</p>

            <p>As someone who is completely new to the field, my skills are quite limited. However, I am a quick learner who is eager to ask questions, receive feedback, and advance my own learning.</p>

            <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my page and to learn more about my (forthcoming) work!</p>
